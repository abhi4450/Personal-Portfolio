            <h2>My Journey</h2>
            <p>
              After earning my engineering degree, I began to prepare for the
              civil services examination. I enhanced my time management skills
              over the course of a year of preparation.Unfortunately, For a
              number of reasons,I was obliged to join my family-run
              business.There, I worked for more than four years and developed a
              wealth of customer service knowledge that helped me become more
              socially adept.I recently took 1.5+ years long hiatus to add the
              aforementioned technical skills and confident to jump back into
              the game and ready to serve in the area of engineering.
